# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is an early-stage compiler project for **FC** (version 0.7 draft), a systems programming language that transpiles to C11. The compiler (`./fc`) is implemented in C and lives in `src/`. The language specification is in `spec/fc-spec.html`.

## Build & Run

- **`make`** — Build the compiler (produces `./fc` in the project root)
- **`make test`** — Build and run all tests
- **`make clean`** — Remove build artifacts
- **`./fc input.fc -o output.c`** — Compile a single FC file to C

The compiler is built with `cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -g`. Tests compile the generated C with `cc -std=c11 -Wall -Werror`, so the emitted C must be warning-clean.

## Git Workflow

- **Never auto-commit** — only commit when explicitly asked
- When asked to commit, always run `git diff HEAD` (or `git diff --cached` if already staged) and base the commit message **only on what the diff shows**. Do not rely on conversation memory — changes may have been made and reverted during the session. Also check `git log --oneline -3` to match the repository's commit message style
- Default branch is `main`; experimental work may happen in other branches — always check the current branch before acting
- Working changes may be discarded and branches may be abandoned — follow the user's lead
- No `Co-Authored-By` attribution in commit messages

## Language Overview

FC is a C-targeting language with these core design constraints:
- **Target**: C11 (using `int8_t`/etc. from `<stdint.h>`, `_Static_assert`, anonymous unions)
- **Memory model**: Manual, no GC, no borrow checker — follows C's philosophy
- **Syntax**: Indentation-based (offside rule, spaces only — tabs are a compile error)
- **Comments**: `//` line comments, `/* */` block comments (nestable). No `#` comments.
- **Type inference**: Directional (bottom-up, inside-out), never global unification
- **Generics**: Monomorphized at compile time, zero runtime cost

## Compiler Architecture

The compiler pipeline is: **source → lexer → parser → pass1 → pass2 → mono discovery → codegen → C file**.

### Source files (`src/`)

- **`main.c`** — Entry point. Reads input file, runs the pipeline, writes output.
- **`lexer.c/h`** — Tokenizer. Scans source into tokens, then runs a layout pass that converts indentation into `INDENT`/`DEDENT`/`NEWLINE` tokens (offside rule). Also handles same-level match blocks where `|` acts as a delimiter.
- **`token.c/h`** — Token types and interning. All identifier/keyword strings are interned for pointer-equality comparison.
- **`parser.c/h`** — Pratt parser. Produces an AST of `Expr` and `Decl` nodes. Handles expressions (12 precedence levels), statements, patterns, and declarations.
- **`ast.h`** — AST node definitions. `Expr` (expressions, including `let` bindings), `Pattern` (match patterns), `Decl` (top-level declarations), `Program` (root).
- **`pass1.c/h`** — First pass. Walks declarations to collect top-level names, struct/union layouts, and function signatures into a `SymbolTable`. Enables forward references.
- **`pass2.c/h`** — Second pass (type checker). Walks expressions with a scope chain, infers types bottom-up, resolves identifiers, checks type compatibility, validates casts and widening. Assigns unique codegen names to local bindings for shadowing support. Registers monomorphized generic instances and resolves their concrete types. Uses `diag_error` (not `diag_fatal`) so multiple type errors are reported in a single compilation; erroneous expressions receive the poison type `TYPE_ERROR` which propagates silently to suppress cascading false positives.
- **`monomorph.c/h`** — Monomorphization table and utilities. Tracks generic instantiations (functions, structs, unions) with their mangled names and concrete types. `mono_discover_transitive()` runs after pass2 to find all transitive instantiations (generic functions calling other generic functions) via a fixpoint AST walk. `mono_resolve_type_names()` resolves nested generic type references (e.g., self-referential struct fields) to mangled C identifiers.
- **`codegen.c/h`** — C code emitter. Walks the typed AST and emits C11 source. Handles typedef generation for slices/options, function declarations, struct/union definitions, and expression emission. Emits monomorphized copies of generic functions/structs using a substitution context (`SubstCtx`) that replaces type variables with concrete types at emit time.
- **`types.c/h`** — Type representation and utilities. Defines `Type` (int8–uint64, isize, usize, float32/64, bool, str, cstr, pointer, slice, option, struct, union, function), plus helpers like `type_is_numeric()`, `type_eq()`, `type_name()`.
- **`diag.c/h`** — Diagnostics. `diag_error()` reports an error with source location and continues (used by pass2 for error accumulation); `diag_fatal()` reports and exits immediately (used by lexer/parser for unrecoverable errors). `diag_error_count()` gates progression to later pipeline stages.
- **`common.c/h`** — Shared utilities. Arena allocator, dynamic array macro (`DA_APPEND`).

## Key Language Design Decisions

### Type System
- No explicit type annotations on bindings — always inferred from RHS
- Function parameter types are always required (they anchor inference)
- No function overloading — names always resolve to exactly one function
- Implicit widening only where lossless (e.g., `int32` → `int64`, NOT int → float)
- Integer-to-float always requires an explicit cast
- No `null` in the language — option types (`T?`) replace nullable values
- **Type aliases are true aliases**: `str`, `cstr`, `str32` are desugared to their underlying types (`uint8[]`, `uint8*`, `uint32[]`) internally with a `const char *alias` field on `Type` for display purposes. They are fully interchangeable with their underlying types — `str` and `uint8[]` are the same type, `cstr` and `uint8*` are the same type. The alias only affects `type_name()` output in diagnostics, never type equality or semantics. C interop details (e.g., `const char*` for C string functions) are handled only at extern call boundaries in codegen, not in the type system.

### Compilation Model
- **Two-pass**: First pass collects top-level names/types/layouts; second pass type-checks expressions
- Top-level declarations can reference each other regardless of order
- Local bindings resolve left-to-right within function bodies

### Generated C Patterns
- Signed integer arithmetic uses cast-through-unsigned to define overflow: `(int32_t)((uint32_t)a + (uint32_t)b)`
- Shift amounts are masked to avoid C UB: `a << (b & 31)` for 32-bit types
- Bounds checks emit `abort()` before slice accesses
- Option unwrap (`x!`) emits a tag check before value read
- Struct/union equality emits generated comparison functions

### Types and Literals
- Default integer: `int32`; default float: `float64`
- Suffixed literals: `42i8`, `42u64`, `3.14f32`
- Platform-width types: `isize` (signed, `ptrdiff_t`), `usize` (unsigned, `size_t`); suffixes `42i`, `42u`
- No implicit widening to/from `isize`/`usize` — explicit casts required
- String types: `str` = `uint8[]` (fat pointer), `cstr` = `uint8*` (null-terminated, C interop), `str32` = `uint32[]`
- `any*` = opaque pointer (`void*`), cannot be dereferenced

### Control Flow
- `if`, `match`, `loop` are expressions
- `return`, `break`, `continue` are void-typed expressions (enable early-return in expression positions)
- `loop` produces a value via `break value`; `for` is always void
- `match` is exhaustive; wildcard `_` satisfies exhaustiveness

### Function Syntax
- Functions/lambdas do **not** have return type annotations — the return type is always inferred
- Correct: `let f = (x: int32) -> x * 2` or with a block body: `let f = (x: int32) ->\n    x * 2`
- **Wrong**: `let f = (x: int32) -> int32 = x * 2` — this is not valid FC syntax
- The `->` token introduces the function body (or separates param types in function type syntax like `(int32) -> int32`)

### Bindings
- `let`: immutable binding, not addressable, capturable in closures (by copy)
- `let mut`: mutable binding, addressable (`&x` → `T*`), not capturable in closures
- Both `let` and `let mut` allow field/element mutation — `let` controls reassignability, not content mutation
- Shadowing is allowed (any combination of `let`/`let mut`)

### Operators
- No compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) — only plain `=`
- Bitwise operators bind tighter than comparison (fixes C's `x & mask == 0` wart)
- `!` is postfix option-unwrap AND prefix boolean-not (context-dependent)
- `->` means: pointer field access, function type arrow, OR match arm separator (context-dependent)

### Match Arm Indentation
Match arms (`|` pipes) align with the `match` keyword, **not** indented under it. The lexer's layout pass treats `|` as a same-level delimiter:
```fc
match x with
| some(v) -> use(v)
| none -> fallback()
```

### Naming Conventions (FC code)
- All user-defined names use **lowercase snake_case**: `let my_func`, `struct my_point`, `union my_shape`, `module my_module`
- This applies to struct names, union names, variant names, function names, module names, variable names
- Type keywords are lowercase: `int32`, `float64`, `bool`, `str`
- Test `.fc` files must follow these conventions

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/cases/`, organized into subdirectories by functional category:

- `expressions/` — arithmetic, bitwise, boolean, comparison, literals, overflow, shifts, div/mod, comments, int range checks
- `bindings/` — shadow, void_bind, let_void, unused_local
- `functions/` — func definitions, recursion, early return, func types, top_level_as_value
- `control_flow/` — if, else, loop, for, break, continue
- `structs/` — struct creation, destructuring, field mutation, omitted fields
- `unions/` — union creation, variants, mixed/no payload
- `pattern_matching/` — match syntax and patterns (struct, union, option, wildcard, complex)
- `exhaustiveness/` — Maranget algorithm (bool, int, option, union, struct, nested, generic)
- `equality/` — structural equality codegen (struct, union, slice, option, string, widen, generic)
- `casts_widening/` — cast, widen (type conversions)
- `options/` — option, unwrap, none, nested options
- `pointers/` — pointer, deref, ptr arithmetic/ordering, addr_of, ptr_to_ptr
- `slices/` — slice, subslice, stack_array, bounds checks
- `strings/` — string, cstr, str interop, interpolation, alloc_str
- `memory/` — alloc, free, sizeof, default, linked_list
- `modules/` — module, import, namespace, private (single-file tests as `.fc` files, multi-file tests as subdirectories)
- `closures/` — capture, lambda, closure semantics, globals
- `generics/` — generic functions/structs/unions, monomorphization, dedup
- `type_properties/` — static type props (int32.min, float64.nan) + typevar props ('a.bits)
- `native_types/` — isize/usize literals, arithmetic, casts, generics, error cases
- `extern/` — extern declarations, conditional compilation (#if/#else/#end)
- `io/` — print, io read/write, eprint, stdin/stdout, sys, main_args

Each **single-file test** is an `.fc` file plus one of:
- `.expected_exit` — expected exit code (0–255); the test compiles and runs
- `.error` — substring expected in compiler stderr; the test must fail to compile

Each **multi-file test** is a subdirectory containing:
- Multiple `.fc` files (e.g. `main.fc`, `lib.fc`) — all compiled together
- `expected_exit` or `error` (no dot prefix) — the expected result
- `deps` (optional) — one path per line (relative to project root) for external dependencies like `stdlib/io.fc`

Run with `make test`. The test runner (`tests/run_tests.sh`) compiles FC→C with `./fc`, then C→binary with `cc -std=c11 -Wall -Werror`. Test names display as `modules/cross_ns_import`, etc. Every test file (including `.error` tests) must have a valid `let main` function — error tests put the bad code inside `main`'s body, not at top level. The generated C is compiled with `-Werror`, so all variables must be used.

### Multi-file tests

Multi-file tests each get their own subdirectory within a category dir, making it clear which files belong together. For example:
```
modules/cross_ns_import/
    main.fc          # file with main, imports from lib
    lib.fc           # file defining the namespace/module
    expected_exit    # expected exit code
```
The test runner discovers all `.fc` files in the subdirectory and compiles them together. If a `deps` file exists, the listed files are also included in compilation. Use `deps` instead of copying stdlib files into test directories — e.g., a `deps` file containing `stdlib/io.fc` for tests that use `std::io`.

### Test coverage philosophy

Correctness is imperative in compiler implementation — exhaustive testing is not optional. Every new feature, bug fix, or spec change must be accompanied by a thorough test suite that covers not just the happy path but all meaningful combinations and edge cases.

When adding a feature or fixing a bug, add tests that exercise:
- The happy path (feature works as specified)
- All syntax forms and variations (e.g., every import form the spec defines)
- Edge cases and boundary conditions (empty inputs, single elements, maximum values)
- Error cases (invalid input produces a clear compile error, type mismatches, ordering violations)
- Interactions between features (e.g., shadowing + mutability, match + options + unions, generics + equality, nested types)
- Multiple type combinations (e.g., if a feature works on structs, unions, slices, options, and strings — test all of them, not just one)
- Generic/monomorphized variants of the feature

Aim for dozens of test cases per feature, not a handful. A bug caught by a test during development costs minutes; a bug discovered in user code costs hours.

Exit codes are mod 256 — keep expected values under 256 to avoid confusion.

## Workflow

- Run `make test` to confirm all tests pass before presenting a summary of changes

## Spec Reference

The `spec/` folder contains:
- **`fc-spec.html`** — Full language specification. Self-contained HTML with embedded markdown rendered by `marked.js`. Open in a browser to read.
- **`grammar.bnf`** — BNF grammar for the language syntax.
- **`TODO.md`** — Outstanding spec/compiler tasks.

Spec sections are organized as:
- Part 1 — Foundations (types, literals, operators, let/mut, inference)
- Part 2 — Control flow (if, match, loop, for)
- Part 3 — Functions (lambdas, closures, capture)
- Part 4 — Type system (structs, unions, options, pointers, slices, function types)
- Part 5 — Memory management (alloc, free, stack/heap)
- Part 6 — I/O, system & formatting (std::io module, std::sys module, print/eprint/fprint/sprint)
- Part 7 — Program structure (modules, namespaces, imports, conditional compilation)
- Part 8 — C interop (extern, any*, variadics)
- Part 9 — Generics (type variables, monomorphization)
